# Bookstore by Beego

- Utilized go and beego framework for seamless database connection and data modeling.
  Also MVC design was applied base on beego architecture.
- Just like my other [bookstore projects](http://ccapeng.gitbook.io/bookstore), 
  I use bookstore as my data modeling.
  
- In this project, sqlite was used for the easy to quick start.

- To run it, type `go run main.go` in the project root directory.
